So I start a two year journey in the woods near Appleton, Oxfordshire this weekend with Woodland Ways. Friday to Sunday in February. Needed a large pack so I could take everything I needed, and settled on the Atmos 65 from Osprey. Amazing piece of kit. Right now it's holding my tent, four season sleeping bag, cooking kit, axe and knife, clothes and
food and the only item outside is the self-inflating mat. The guy who reviews it below doesn't mention the built-in rain cover, but I'm more
likely to need it than him.

As for blades, haven't decided on a new knife as yet, but I've packed a wildlife hatchet from <a href="https://www.gransforsbruk.com/en/" target="_blank">Gransfors Bruk</a>. I've had it for a few years and it's never let me down. Also the perfect size to take into the woods for a weekend.

I tend to sleep on the ground in the colder months, and go up into a hammock as it gets warmer, so for this trip I'll be bedding down in the <a href="http://www.snugpak.com/outdoor/ionosphere-2577" target="_blank">Snugpak Ionosphere</a>. Goes up in a few minutes and surprisingly weather-proof.
