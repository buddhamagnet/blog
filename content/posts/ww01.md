So things didn't really start out the way I planned, but such is life. Storm Doris ensured our fragile and weak-minded train network was unable to deliver me to the inaugaral weekend of the course. However, I've started the course before, and had to pull out for various reasons, so until the next one, here's some videos of the very first Woodland Wayer course featuring Joseph Philbin, now an apprentice at Woodland Ways. Enjoy!
